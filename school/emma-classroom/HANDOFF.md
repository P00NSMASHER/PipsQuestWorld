# Emma Study Classroom handoff

## Implemented

- Made lifetime progress persistence monotonic across out-of-order DataStore
  completions. Older asynchronous saves can no longer reduce total correct,
  completed sessions, or per-skill correct counts.
- Player-removal and server-shutdown paths now await their final DataStore write
  instead of starting a task and relying on a fixed two-second delay.
- Restored normal Roblox movement, jump, autorotation and touch camera control.
- Added a 44px `Study view` / `Look around` toggle. Study view retains the intentional teacher/Smartboard/doorway composition; Look around restores the character camera.
- Strengthened classroom CI so a future permanent movement lock fails the tiny-game contract.

## Actually tested

- Executed the actual server source against a forced stale-save regression and
  verified that newer lifetime/session/skill totals survive.
- Executed the shutdown callback and verified its final write is visible before
  the callback returns.
- Luau compilation for every classroom client/server/shared source.
- Isolated Rojo place build.
- Classroom CI contract checks, including both camera modes and absence of movement-lock assignments.

## Not tested

- Roblox Studio runtime launch.
- Live Roblox DataStore behavior under throttling, shutdown, and reconnect.
- Physical iPhone thumbstick, jump, camera orbit and safe-area interaction.
- Final composed Study view against the authorized classroom reference.

## Known release hold

This candidate is not runtime-complete or publishable until an actual Roblox/iPhone capture proves movement, camera restoration, Study view composition, question interaction and the 10-question loop on the exact candidate head.
